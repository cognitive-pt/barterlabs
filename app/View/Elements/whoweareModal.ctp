	    			<p>Barterlabs is a free commerce site for trading services-for-services and things-for-things.</p>

	    			<p>Think Craigslist, only instead of spending money, you trade stuff for other stuff.</p>

	    			<p>This is a place where yard work can equal cookies, or a lawnmower can equal a new summer dress!</p>

	    			<p>Our goal is to build a community of people who trade everything.</p>

	    			<p>Sign-up today, build a profile, and let people know you're ready to trade!</p>

	    			<p>We are currently in our beta test stage, so thanks for your patience and feedback!</p>
